Run this script using python3 inside of a ros package that uses python and c++ nodes to generate CMakeLists.txt and package.xml that are formatted for this purpose.

navigate to ~/your/ros/package/

enter "python3 ~/path/to/scripts/create_cmakelists/create_cmakelists.py"

You'll still need to update the package name in each file.

The script sets the package name to `add_your_package_name_in_cmakelists_and_packagexml`, the description to `TODO: Package description`, the maintainer email to `addyour@email.here`, and the license to `MIT`.
