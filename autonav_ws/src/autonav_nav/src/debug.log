IMPORTANT: no SMELLING THE WAYPOINTS, so !(waypoints.size() > 0)
then the breadth-first search (where we dont actually append more points)
then back to DoAStar, and we update the grid data fine
then we go to Search()
then immediately hit FOUND GOAL, despite certainly not finding the goal? hmm...
then we head to ReconstructPath
then we error somewhere between that line and TRAVERSING, because we never actually get the TRAVERSING message
